## Maintenance

To run locally, clone the repo and run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate 207_Final_Project
```

This will track both conda and pip packages. As we add packages to our code, run `conda env update --file environment.yml --prune` and commit/push changes. Pull down changes periodically to stay up-to-date.
