## Description

This project uses machine learning to classify weather from images. Models aim to improve from a baseline logistic regression model with an initial validation accuracy of 51%. Preprocessing techniques include oversampling, data augmentation, K-Means for color quantization, PCA for dimensionality reduction, segmenting and de-noising images with SAM (Segment Anything Model), and fine-tuning on top of ResNet50. 

Preprocessed data are fed into models such as logistic regression or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Predictions outputted by CNNs using K-Means and PCA datasets are stacked into ensemble models of logistic regression, then a CNN. Model hyperparameters are tuned using keras hyperband tuner. The best performing model used the ResNet50 features into a simple logistic regression, and produces a test accuracy of 90%, a significant improvement from the baseline. This model can be used for altering the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles for safer driving in dangerous weather.
